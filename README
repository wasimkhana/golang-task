# Aqarsas Backend Assignment

The assignment is to implement web services (two endpoints) using Go language. The endpoints will be accessible at /hai/ and /haicounter/ paths using GET method in http protocol. Additionally, you have to write tests (see web_server_test.go) that check your endpoints.


- We have provided a sample server code to start with (web_server.go)
- We have provided data also in an sqlite database file. The database contains a sample list of hai details (neighborhoods) in Saudi Arabia.

1. For the first task Your job to implement /hai/ endpoint that accepts any of the three parameters (id  - hai - city) and return hai data in JSON format. You have to query the database to get the results. Additionally, string parameters (hai-city) may contain part or full expected string, and you have to search the database for a possible list of matches.


Usage examples: 

- 127.0.0.1:3333/hai/?id=4

sample Expected result:
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": 4,
      "city": "الرياض",
      "haiName": "العزيزية"
    }
  ]
}

- 127.0.0.1:3333/hai/?hai=م
sample expected result: all hais that contains the م letter

- 127.0.0.1:3333/hai/?hai=العارض&city=الرياض
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": 9,
      "city": "الرياض",
      "haiName": "العارض"
    }
  ]
}

2. For the second task Your job to implement /haicounter/ endpoint that returns list of cities and number of hais in each city. You have to query the database to get the results.


Usage example: 

- 127.0.0.1:3333/hailist/

sample Expected result:
{
  "result": [
    {
      "city": "الرياض",
      "haicounter": "185"
    }, ... etc (complete list of cities)
  ]
}



Points that strengthen your work:
- Good Error handling and testing (dont forget you have to write a test file).
- Performance, speed, and efficiency. (hint: think about the fastest way possible).
- Deliver the assignment as early as possible.
